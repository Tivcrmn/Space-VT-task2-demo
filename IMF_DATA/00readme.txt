This directory provides access to the hourly-resolution OMNI 2 data set
and to daily and 27-day averaged versions thereof, and to a high resolution
(1-min) OMNI (HRO) data set, to a 5-min version thereof, and to related
1-min spacecraft-specific data sets.

The OMNI data sets characterize the state of the solar wind near the 
magnetosphere.  All versions have magnetic field and plasma data from
each of multiple spacecraft, where the plasma densities and temperatures
have been cross-normalized.  Most versions also have energetic particle fluxes
and geomagnetic and solar activity indices.

At this writing, OMNI runs from 1963 (OMNI 2) or 1995 (HRO) to within
a few weeks of current time.

The data in the high resolution data sets have been shifted from their
spacecraft locations of observation to the bow shock nose at 15-s resolution.  
The ~L1 data (ISEE 3, Wind, ACE) in OMNI 2 were shifted with simpler 
algorithms to Earth at 1-5 min resolution.  In both cases new 1-min or 1-hr
averages were computed at the "targets."

The content and building of hourly OMNI 2 are extensively described at 
ftp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/omni/low_res_omni/omni2.text,
http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/ow_data.html

The content and building of high resolution OMNI (HRO) and of related 
spacecraft-specific data sets, used in building HRO and also made accessible
via this directory, are extensively described at 
http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/HROdocum.html

In addition to ftp accessibility, OMNI 2 data are accessible with multiple
functionalities from http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ow.html, and HRO and 
related spacecraft-specific data are accessible with multiple 
functionalities from http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ow_min.html

This directory consists of subdirectories and files of data and/or documentation.  
The subdirectories lead to HRO and related spacecraft-specific data sets 
and to the version of OMNI that was superseded by OMNI 2 in 2003.

The data and documentation files include:
1. Annual OMNI 2 data files in standard OMNI ASCII format
 at /low_res_omni and /high_res_omni dir.

2. Annual OMNI 2 data files in "COHOWeb" ASCII format and content
(e.g., omni_m1963.dat) at /low_res_omni dir.

3. The low and high resolution OMNI CDF files at /omni_cdaweb dir.

4. All-time daily and 27-day averaged versions of OMNI 2.
(omni_01_av.dat and omni_27_av.dat) at /low_res_omni dir.
